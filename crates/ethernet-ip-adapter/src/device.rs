//! # The device seam: what a *protocol adapter* talks to
//!
//! [`DeviceSession`] is one live connection to one device. Implement it once per protocol — for
//! this adapter the protocol is **EtherNet/IP** (CIP explicit messaging), in `src/eip/`, and an
//! in-process [`crate::sim`] backend stands in for a PLC on a laptop. Everything above the seam
//! (the connection lifecycle, backoff, publishing, health) is written against the trait and never
//! learns the protocol.
//!
//! **The boundary rule, and it is worth enforcing in review:** a backend knows protocols. It does
//! **not** know EdgeCommons topics, the UNS, message envelopes, or metrics. If your `impl
//! DeviceSession` imports `edgecommons::uns`, the seam has leaked.
//!
//! ## Signals, not tags
//!
//! A **signal** is one data point — a measured value with identity, quality, and timestamps.
//! (A CIP controller calls it a "tag"; Modbus calls it a "register".) The word "tag" is reserved in
//! EdgeCommons for the envelope's *business metadata*, which is a different thing entirely.
//!
//! ## Quality is not optional
//!
//! Every sample carries a `quality` normalized to `GOOD | BAD | UNCERTAIN`, plus the native code
//! in `qualityRaw` for diagnosis. This is what lets a consumer gate on quality without knowing the
//! protocol — and it is why a read failure must be published as a `BAD` sample rather than
//! swallowed. A signal that silently stops updating is indistinguishable from one that is simply
//! not changing.
